The pantry class has three funtions to stock it with food, add an item, and get an item. It also has an overridden representational string.

The vendor class has two functions that allow you to install a Vending Machine object and restock that object.

The vending machine class allows a user to purchase products from a vending machine object, deposit money into the machine, cancel your transaction and have your money returned, and also allows you to restock the machine.
